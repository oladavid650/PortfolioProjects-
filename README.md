# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

This project involves the analysis of COVID-19 data obtained from Our World in Data and the cleaning of Nashville Housing data. The analysis focuses on understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the data cleaning process pertains to the Nashville Housing dataset. SQL Server was used for both the analysis and data cleaning tasks.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/COVID-Data-Nashville-Housing.git
```
2. Set up SQL Server and ensure it is running on your machine.
3. Import the COVID-19 data into a SQL Server database. Instructions for importing data can be found in the [COVID-19 Data Analysis](#covid-19-data-analysis) section.
4. Clean the Nashville Housing data using the provided SQL scripts in the [Nashville Housing Data Cleaning](#nashville-housing-data-cleaning) section.

## Usage
Once the installation is complete, you can use the project as follows:
1. Refer to the `covid_analysis.sql` file for the COVID-19 data analysis. Execute the SQL queries to perform the analysis and obtain insights.
2. For Nashville Housing Data cleaning, execute the SQL scripts in the `nashville_housing_cleaning` directory. These scripts provide step-by-step instructions on how to clean and prepare the data for further analysis.

Please note that the COVID-19 data is not included in this repository. You will need to obtain the data separately from Our World in Data and import it into your SQL Server database.

## COVID-19 Data Analysis
The COVID-19 data used for analysis was obtained from [Our World in Data](https://www.ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). To perform the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Download the COVID-19 dataset in CSV format from the provided link.
2. Import the CSV data into a SQL Server database. You can use tools like SQL Server Management Studio or the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard to accomplish this task.
3. Refer to the `covid_analysis.sql` file for the SQL queries and instructions on how to perform the analysis.

## Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
